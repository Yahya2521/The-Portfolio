                    </h2>
                    <p class="text"> I started learning programming because I had a lot of free time and used to sit on
                        the computer for hours doing nothing useful. One day I thought, why not try something new? I
                        searched for tutorials and found HTML and CSS — and when I saw how a few lines of code could
                        create a real webpage, I got hooked. It felt fun and different, and even though I’m still
                        learning and make a lot of mistakes, I actually enjoy the process now. What started as just
                        killing time turned into something I genuinely want to get better at.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="text"> My first programming languages were HTML and CSS — I actually started learning both
                        at the same time. I didn’t really plan it that way, but every tutorial I watched included them
                        together, so I just followed along. HTML helped me structure the page, and CSS made it look
                        nice, and I liked how I could instantly see the results in the browser. It felt simple and
                        visual, which made it a perfect place to start without getting overwhelmed by complicated code.

                    <h2> Why Functions and Debugging Totally Confused Me at First
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text">The first things that really confused me in programming were functions and
                        debugging. When I started learning, functions felt like some weird block of code that everyone
                        was using but I didn’t fully get why or how. And debugging? That was a nightmare at first — I’d
                        get errors and have no clue what they meant or where the problem was. It felt like I was just
                        guessing. Over time, I started to understand functions better by writing small ones myself, and
                        debugging became easier once I learned to read error messages instead of panicking. Still not
                        perfect at it, but way better than when I started.</p>

                    <h2> Common Mistakes Beginners Make (And ofcourse I Made Them Too)
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text">When I started programming, I made a lot of mistakes, and I'm sure many beginners do
                        the same. I used to copy-paste code without understanding it, which made debugging a nightmare.
                        I also got scared of errors, thinking I messed everything up, but I soon learned that errors are
                        part of the process. Skipping the basics seemed like a good idea at first, but it only slowed me
                        down later on. I didn’t ask for help when I needed it, and spent way too much time trying to
                        figure things out on my own. Finally, I didn’t practice enough — watching tutorials isn’t
                        enough; real progress happens when you write and solve problems yourself. All these mistakes
                        were frustrating, but they taught me a lot!</p>

                    <h2> Programming is an Art
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text"> Programming is not just a technical skill; it’s an art, much like music. Just as a
                        musician combines notes to create a melody, a programmer combines lines of code to create
                        something functional and beautiful. In music, each note plays a role in the harmony, and in
                        programming, every line of code contributes to the overall structure and flow of the project.
                        Debugging is like tuning an instrument — you adjust, fix, and refine until everything sounds (or
                        runs) perfectly. Both require creativity, patience, and practice to master. Programming, like
                        music, is about crafting something that resonates, whether it’s through a song or a seamless
                        app..</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="text"> To learn coding without paying for courses, you can take advantage of many free
                        online resources. Websites like FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and edX offer comprehensive lessons in
                        different programming languages. YouTube also has many tutorials that cover coding basics and
                        practical projects. Joining developer communities on forums like Stack Overflow and Reddit can
                        provide support and guidance from experienced programmers. Additionally, free eBooks and
                        technical articles are available online to deepen your knowledge.
